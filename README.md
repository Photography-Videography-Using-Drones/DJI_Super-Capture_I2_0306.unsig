# Capture_I2_0306.unsig
Program that is used to get the 0306.unsig from I2 to enable making a custom I2 FC

To make a Super-Patched version of the firmware for Inspire 2 I need someone to capture a file called 0306.unsig from the drone. Iâ€™ve made a program that will do it all automatically but it requires an I2 machine to do it which I do not have. If you are willing please let me know and send this file to me so I can make a custom flight controller for I2. You will need to be on firmware version v1.02.0200 please. Thanks!

**UPDATE:**This repo has served its purpose and Super-Patcher now supports Inspire 2. Big thanks to Mstoozler for using this repo and providing the 0306.unsig for Inspire 2
